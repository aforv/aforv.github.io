Hey, I'm aver (Formerly AverageUTDRWeeb), an Undertale and Deltarune addict. I make
videos on YouTube.

    It started when I wanted to make a channel about music. But I decided it
not was my way to go. The first video I have ever made is from
Feb 21, 2022. it is about a Roblox clip of me clipping through the floor
while trying to attempt a glitch called "Laugh Clip." Laugh Clip is a glitch
where you can make yourself clip through walls while you're emoting. Which
this video isn't about music at all, the second video on my channel
though is a bad, old, cringe audio edit. It was my first time doing audio
edits and the last time also. I attempted to make another one but it
sucked so bad that I got rid of the idea of being a successful
musician after making 3 videos about music.

    The first video that reach 100 views is this video. I am pretty proud of
how it turned out, but all of the video is just misinformations left and
right.

    The first short is what made me to this point. It is the first time I've
ever felt that feeling, when you see your notifications go "9+" and seeing
that your video views skyrocketed to the maximum heights of space, and
it's only the 10th video that I have uploaded, and it's my first short.

    The month after I uploaded my first short ever, 100 subscribers,
short after; 1,000. 2,000. I am now a successful YouTuber.

    After a long time, the short is the best performing short in my
entire channel. It has gained over 800,000 views and it is what made me
even more fame. The fame is coming inside me. ðŸ˜³

    The first tutorial I have made is the most viewed video on my
channel, besides shorts. It's bad and I am planning to make an
updated one.

    Thanks for listening to my story. I have a great fanbase and
I love you guys. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. â™¥
